**Describe the solution you'd like**

- When should this component be used?
- When shouldn’t it be used? For those cases, is there an alternative component you’d recommend (and why do you recommend it)?
- When should each variation of the component be used?
- What are guidelines for the content that could go into this component?
- Are there limitations/restrictions on what it can handle?
- Is anything not going into this first version? What did you exclude and what was the reasoning behind that?
